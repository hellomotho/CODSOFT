For My Data Science Internship Projects
First project: I Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a
Titanic passengers survived. This is a classic beginner
project with readily available data.
The dataset typically used for this project contains information
about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket
class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.
